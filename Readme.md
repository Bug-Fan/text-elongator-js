Here, I have developed a String elongator in JavaScript.
I have tried to implement best possible concepts of JavaScript that I have learned.
I also have tried to reduce the time complexity of the problem by not using any loop.

This program uses string methods, array methods, functions, recursion, and many more.

It accepts a string and a number n.

The string is then elongated i.e., the count of each vowel in the string is multiplied by the value of n.

An example:
Input: Parth, 3
Output: Paaarth
